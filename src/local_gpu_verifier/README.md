# Verifier

The Verifier is a Python-based tool that validates GPU measurements by comparing an authenticated attestation report containing runtime measurements with authenticated golden measurements. Its purpose is to verify if the software and hardware state of the GPU are in accordance with the intended state.

## Pre-requisites:
   Requires Python 3.7 or later.

## Install

### Step 1: Elevate to Root User Privileges (Optional)

If you want the verifier to set the GPU Ready State based on the Attestation results, you will need to elevate the user privilegs to root before you execute the rest of the instructions. For use cases where the user does not intend to set the GPU Ready State (e.g., when using the Attestation SDK), you can install and run the Verifier tool without requiring sudo privileges.

    sudo -i

### Step 2: Create a new Python Virtual Environment

    python3 -m venv  ./prodtest
    source ./prodtest/bin/activate

### Step 3: Install and run Local GPU Verifier

    cd local_gpu_verifier
    pip3 install .
    python3 -m verifier.cc_admin

### Troubleshooting Installation Issues

- If you encounter any pip related issues while building the package, please execute the following commands to update to the latest versions of setuptools and pip

        python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
        pip install -U pip

- If you encounter any permission issues while building the package, please execute the following commands and then build the package again

        cd local_gpu_verifier
        rm -r build

## Module details:
### rim 
RIM is reference integrity manifest containing golden measurements for GPU. You can find the TCG RIM Spec at the following link 
The RIM module performs the parsing and schema validation of the base RIM against the swidtag schema and xml signature schema. Then performs the signature verification
of the base RIM.

The RIM (Reference Integrity Manifest) is a manifest containing golden measurements for the GPU. You can find the TCG RIM Spec at the following link: [TCG RIM Spec](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_RIM_Model_v1p01_r0p16_pub.pdf). The RIM module performs the parsing and schema validation of the base RIM against the SWID tag schema and XML signature schema. It then performs the signature verification of the base RIM.

### attestation
The Attestation module is capable of extracting the measurements and the measurement signature. It then performs signature verification. DMTF's SPDM 1.1 MEASUREMENT response message is used as the attestation report for APM. You can find the SPDM 1.1 specification at the following link: [SPDM 1.1 Specification](https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0274_1.1.3.pdf).

### nvmlHandler
The nvmlHandler module utilizes the NVML API calls to retrieve GPU information, including the driver version, GPU certificates, attestation report, and more.

### verifier
The verifier module utilizes the RIM (Runtime Integrity Measurement) attestation module for parsing the attestation report and performing a runtime comparison of the measurements in the attestation report against the golden measurements stored in RIM.

### cc_admin
The cc_admin module retrieves the GPU information, attestation report, and the driver RIM associated with the driver version. It then proceeds with the authentication of the driver RIM and the attestation report. Afterward, it executes the verifier tool to compare the runtime measurements in the attestation report with the golden measurements stored in the driver RIM.
