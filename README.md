# Confidential GPU Private Preview Onboarding 

The following four major steps are provided to help deploy your first Confidential GPU VM and to run a sample workload. The first two steps help set up the Confidential GPU VM environment. The third step performs attestation verification and ensures the CGPU mode has been turned on successfully. The last step helps run a sample workload to verify and complete the setup. These steps are only required the first time you are deploying your VM. Depending on your network performance and experience with Azure, it may take a few hours to complete the steps, so make sure to set up enough available time.

1. Create CGPU VM 
2. Install GPU Driver 
3. Attestation Verification
